## What is this about ?

This repository contains and/or will contain solutions for problems that I solve on different platforms as **LeetCode**, **Hackerrank**, **Codility** and **Codeforces**.
All the problems solutions are in **C++** for the sole reason of my love to this langugae and how much I want to get better using it.  

## Why you should create your own Playground ?
- Utilize some of your leasure time into self development. 
- Have a taste of competitive programming or train for this field.
- Get better using Data-structures and algorithms which may beneift you at you work. 
- Help others looking for solutions for the same problems. (Try to add comments and explaination if possible).
- Github Contributions can be a motivation to work your hand through these problems.
