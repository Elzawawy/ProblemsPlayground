/* ### Problem:
 * Given: a positive integer
 * Required: its complement number.
 * The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
 * The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
 * You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
 * Problem source and more about it can be found from: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-complement/

    /** Solution 1: Using number of leading zeros.
     * The idea of my solution is to get the number of leading zeros of the `num` input.
     * We then can iterate on the specific bits that represent actual integer value and flip only those.
     * Solution Runtime: 0 ms (Beats 100%)
     * Solution Memory Usage: 5.9 (Beats 100%)
     * @param num the number to get complement of
     * @return complement of num input.
