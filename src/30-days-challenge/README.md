In April 2020, Leetcode has lanuched this amazing [challenge](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/30-day-leetcoding-challenge/). 
A problem appeares at midnight PDT each day, and we had 24 hours to solve it and submit it on the Explore Card. 
If you miss a problem, it'll still be there for you, however, you won't get any LeetCoins for it, and you'll no longer be eligible for the prize draw.

Happily, I was able to complete all 30 problems on time.

In this folder, I would like to contribute my solutions for the problems challenge to everyone that is looking for them if it may help.
In each problem, I added a small **problem description** (mainly the same as the problem statement), a **reference link** for problem, my **solution approach description**, and my **commented code** of course.
